# Calmdo

Calmdo is a project management tool built with the PETAL (Phoenix, Elixir, TailwindCSS, Alpine.js, LiveView) stack. It leverages the [Ash framework](https://ash-hq.org/) for powerful and flexible resource-oriented development.

## Getting Started

To get the application running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    mix setup
    ```

2.  **Start the Phoenix Server:**
    ```bash
    mix phx.server
    ```

You can now access the application at [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000).

## Testing

The E2E tests require `chromedriver` to be installed and accessible, and its version should match your installed Chrome browser.
